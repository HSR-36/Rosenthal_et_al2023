This repository provides pyhthon code used to post process and analyse data collected by three Saildrones (SD1020, Sd1022, SD1023) during their Circumnavigation of Antarctica 2019.
We used this dataset to investigate the impact of submesocale surface SST fronts and smapling frequency on turbulent heat flux variablity. The results are disucssed in Rosenthal et. al. 2023 (currently under revision with Journal of Geophysical Research)
